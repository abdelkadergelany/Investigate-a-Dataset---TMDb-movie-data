# Investigate a Dataset - TMDb movie data
 We will be analysing the following movies dataset collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) to find out what are the determinant factors for the success of a movie.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
